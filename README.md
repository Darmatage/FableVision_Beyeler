# FableVision_Beyeler
All code by Jason Wiser at FableVision Studios (Boston) for the Beyeler Museum (Switzerland).
A one-month project to create a web game for museum goers to interact in new ways with the collection at the museum.
Designed to be played on iPads at the museum, but functional anywhere.

**INSTRUCTIONS:**
Find 3 pieces of art that fit a category, then click that category on the right to submit.
If you are correct (according to the curators), those three will disappear. If not, click again to de-select.
Refresh the options with the "New Cards" button at the bottom.

How many sets can you find before time runs out?
