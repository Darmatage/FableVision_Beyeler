# FableVision_Beyeler
Work at FableVision Studios (Boston) for the Beyeler Museum (Switzerland).
A one-month project to create a web game for museum goers to interact in new ways with the collection at the museum.
Designed to be played on ipads at the museum, but functional anywhere.

Select 1 category on the right and then find 3 pieces of art that fit that category (according to the curators).
Refresh the optiosn with the "New Cards" button at the bottom.
How many sets can you find before time runs out?

Play the game here: http://madwomb.com/HTML5/Beyeler/
